Perfect 🚀 Here’s your **1-Week Helmet Detection Project Plan** — learning + implementation + daily posting:

---

## 🗓 7-Day Roadmap

### **Day 1 – Project Setup & Dataset**

* Learn:

  * What YOLOv8 is (object detection basics).
  * Real-world use case: helmet detection for traffic safety.
* Implement:

  * Set up repo + folder structure (`data/`, `notebooks/`, `models/`, `infra/`).
  * Collect dataset (Roboflow / Kaggle) → helmets vs. no helmets.
  * Convert/organize into YOLO format.
* Post:

  * “Kickstarting my Helmet Detection project with YOLOv8 🚦👷 – today I set up repo & collected dataset!”

---

### **Day 2 – Data Preprocessing**

* Learn:

  * Image annotation formats (YOLO txt, COCO json).
  * Augmentation (flips, rotations, brightness).
* Implement:

  * Clean + preprocess dataset.
  * Add augmentations with Albumentations library.
  * Verify dataset using a quick visualization notebook.
* Post:

  * “Preprocessed & augmented my dataset today 📸🔥 – ensuring YOLOv8 learns from diverse traffic scenarios!”

---

### **Day 3 – Training YOLOv8**

* Learn:

  * YOLOv8 model architecture (backbone, head).
  * Training parameters: epochs, batch size, image size.
* Implement:

  * Train model with Ultralytics YOLOv8 CLI or Python API.
  * Save best weights → `models/best.pt`.
  * Track metrics (mAP, precision, recall).
* Post:

  * “Trained my YOLOv8 model 🚀 – excited to see helmet detection accuracy improving with each epoch!”

---

### **Day 4 – Evaluation & Testing**

* Learn:

  * mAP (mean Average Precision).
  * Confusion matrix & class-wise accuracy.
* Implement:

  * Run inference on test set.
  * Evaluate with confusion matrix & precision-recall.
  * Create demo notebook: input test images → bounding boxes for helmets.
* Post:

  * “Evaluated my helmet detection model 🎯 – achieved X% mAP on test data. Safety first on roads!”

---

### **Day 5 – API & Integration**

* Learn:

  * FastAPI basics (endpoints, request/response).
  * Model inference pipeline for REST API.
* Implement:

  * Wrap YOLOv8 model into FastAPI endpoint (`/predict`).
  * Test locally with sample image uploads.
* Post:

  * “Deployed YOLOv8 into a FastAPI endpoint ⚡ – now I can detect helmets via API calls!”

---

### **Day 6 – Deployment Infra**

* Learn:

  * Docker basics (image, container).
  * Deployment options: Render (free tier) & AWS Lambda.
* Implement:

  * Create Dockerfile for FastAPI app.
  * Deploy on **Render free tier**.
  * (Optional) Set up infra folder with Terraform scripts for AWS.
* Post:

  * “Containerized my FastAPI app 🐳 – YOLOv8 Helmet Detection is live on the cloud!”

---

### **Day 7 – Documentation & Showcase**

* Learn:

  * README writing for projects.
  * LinkedIn/GitHub showcasing best practices.
* Implement:

  * Write clean README: problem → solution → tech stack → demo.
  * Record a short demo video (upload to LinkedIn/GitHub).
* Post:

  * “Wrapped up my 1-week Helmet Detection project 🎉 – from dataset to deployment. Excited to apply this to real traffic safety use cases!”

⚡ After this week → you’ll have a **full end-to-end real-world project** + 7 LinkedIn posts documenting your journey.

Do you want me to also **write the LinkedIn post drafts for each day** so you just copy-paste + add your screenshots, or you prefer to write in your own style?
